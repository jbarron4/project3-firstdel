	  <h2>Goals</h2>
	  <p>Ever since I was young, I've always wanted to use and interact with computers. The amount of functions that they could serve always interested me. 
	  I was especially obsessed with cybersecurity and hacking, including groups such as Anonymous. For this reason, I hope to one day work in the field, 
	  and ultimately to run my own pen-testing firm.</p>
