	  <h2>Hometown</h2>
	  <p>The following is the map of my hometown, Chicago. The city sits right next to Lake Michigan and is the home of some largely known 
	  attractions, such as the Willis Tower (formerly the Sear's Tower), the Cloud Gate (Bean), Ricobene's (one of my favorite restaurants), 
	  and many more</p>

	  <h2>Neighborhood</h2>
	  <p>South Deering is the neighborhood that I grew up in. It is the south part of Chicago and has many childhood memories for me, albeit 
	  not as many as the East Side where most of my friends had lived. My family has lived there my entire life and additionally, I went to 
	  elementary and middle school there.</p>
